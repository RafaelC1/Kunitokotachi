  "history_part_09":"But in the tenth day of its presence in the lab...",
  "history_part_10":"Clean and aparently without any physical harm, she showed up.",
  "history_part_11":"She looked exactly like a normal human.",
  "history_part_12":"She lacked communication skills though.",
  "history_part_13":"We tried to learn from her about she and the sphere,",
  "history_part_14":"but her mind was blank.",
  "history_part_15":"We shelter'er on the labs to try and figure out anything about her origins.",
  "history_part_16":"And we gave her the name of Himiko.",
  "history_part_17":"Right at her first exams,",
  "history_part_18":"We discovered that there were more two spheres of the same kind as the big one inside of her body in place of common organs.",
  "history_part_19":"We were unable to figure out how were they functioning.",
  "history_part_20":"While we did our research, we tried to educate her as a normal child.",
  "history_part_21":"Science, History, Mathematics... And at night, we would lock her in a solitaire.",
  "history_part_22":"I tried though, to lessen her suffering by giving her my fellowship,",
  "history_part_23":"by talking,",
  "history_part_24":"threating her as a friend,",
  "history_part_25":"or maybe...a mother.",
  "history_part_26":"On the other side of things,",
  "history_part_27":"I would argue about the psychological pressure we were causing at her with this research.",
  "history_part_28":"Those spheres inside of her, and even the possibility of memories she cares with her",
  "history_part_29":" could be our only hope against that alien race!",
  "history_part_30":"My hopes on the life of the girl would only go away with time. So after a year of her arrival...",
  "history_part_31":"We noticed that the matter inside of her would attract each other with some kind of force,",
  "history_part_32":"and constantly! And that was causing her physiological problems.",
  "history_part_33":"It was also surprising to notice that the matter wasn't the same anymore.",
  "history_part_34":"So, we decided to do a surgery on her to get one of those spheres out of her body and replace it with an artificial organ.",
  "history_part_part_35":"The matter was now very malleable, it would expand when exposed to heat and getting super rigid at cold",
  "history_part_36":"So we built a experimental plasma cannon with the matter as the main component",
  "history_part_37":"and the results were a success. It would destroy everything its projectiles touched, but the matter.",
  "history_part_38":"Our next step was to build a fighter spacecraft made specially of that matter,",
  "history_part_39":"as a possible armor against the aliens.",
  "history_part_40":"But another problem would then enter our ways:",
  "history_part_41":"We noticed the matter would get unstable everytime it was far from Himiko.",
  "history_part_42":"Retracting itself to its nucleus.",
  "history_part_43":"The lab arrived to the absurd conclusion that we needed to build that fighter around the girl.", "history_part_44":"And I couldn't stop them.",
  "history_part_45":"We discovered though,",
  "history_part_46":"that while we were working on the fighter, my body developed the same matter at the same place as Himiko,",
  "history_part_57":"in misterious ways. And the best explanation we came up with for that event was that we just spent too much time together, and that sure was the reason.",
  "history_part_58":"I was able to maintain the fighter in it's normal state.",
  "history_part_59":"So I proposed to the doctors that they let me pilot it in her place.",
